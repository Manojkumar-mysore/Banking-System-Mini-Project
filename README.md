# 🏦 Banking System Mini Project (Python)

This is a simple *Python-based Banking System Mini Project* created using *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* concepts.  
The system simulates a real-world banking experience where users can choose between a *Savings Account* or a *Current Account, perform basic operations, and even use an **Overdraft limit* for Current Accounts.

- Encapsulation (data protection)  
- Conditional Logic (if-else operations)

## 💡 How It Works
1. The user is prompted to *create an account*.  
2. Choose between:
   - 🏦 *Savings Account*
   - 💼 *Current Account* (comes with ₹1000 overdraft limit)  
3. Perform operations such as:
   - Deposit money  
   - Withdraw money  
   - Check balance  
   - Display account details  

If a *Current Account* holder withdraws beyond their balance, they can use the *overdraft limit of ₹1000*.
